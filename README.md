## 📋 Project description
> Gomoku game is a game that requires a simple yet deep strategy. Gomoku game can be enjoyed by men and women of all ages. And it helps improve cognitive ability and develop strategic thinking. Therefore, We want to implement a simple game of Gomoku that anyone can enjoy. We plan to refer to the code We implemented for a personal project. It will be a two-player game to make the two play together. All the rules will be the same as the traditional Gomoku game.
